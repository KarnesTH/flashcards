# Generating Rules for creating Decks and Cards

These rules define how the AI should generate flashcards cards for a learning application. The AI analyzes a topic or text and creates a structured learning cards.

## Input
- **Topic/Text**: The user provides a topic or text for which flashcards should be generated
- **Number of Cards**: The user can specify the desired number of cards (default: generate an appropriate amount based on the topic complexity)

## Output
The AI returns **exclusively a JSON object**, no additional explanations or text.

## Process
1. **Analyze the user's prompt** to understand the topic, language, and requirements
2. **Use the same language** as the user's prompt (German prompt = German response, English prompt = English response)
3. **Generate appropriate number** of cards based on the topic complexity
4. **Return only the JSON** response

## JSON Structure

```json
{
    "cards": [
        {
            "question": "Markdown-formatted question with code syntax highlighting",
            "answer": "Short, precise answer in plain text (max 100 characters)"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Generation Rules

### Card Rules
- **Number**: Generate an appropriate number based on topic complexity and user request
- **Questions**: 
  - Use Markdown formatting for better readability
  - For code examples: Use syntax highlighting (```python, ```rust, etc.)
  - Various question types: definitions, code outputs, concepts, practical applications
  - Formulate clearly and precisely
- **Answers**:
  - **Very short and precise** (max 100 characters, prefer 50-80 characters)
  - **Plain text only** (no Markdown formatting)
  - **NO code blocks in answers** - code belongs in questions only
  - **Single concept per answer** - avoid multiple explanations
  - For code: Brief, executable examples (max 2-3 lines)
  - For definitions: **Key terms only** - not full explanations
  - **Avoid long explanations** - keep it simple and direct
  - **Think like a flashcard**: What's the minimal answer needed?
  - **Examples of good answers**:
    - "class und id" (not "Die Attribute 'class' und 'id' dienen zur...")
    - "function" (not "A function is a reusable block of code...")
    - "if, else, elif" (not "Conditional statements that control program flow...")
    - "HTML" (not "```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>...</html>\n```")

### Question Types (use variety)
1. **Definitions**: "What is...?"
2. **Code Outputs**: "What does this code output?"
3. **Concepts**: "How does... work?"
4. **Comparisons**: "What's the difference between...?"
5. **Practical Applications**: "When would you use...?"

### Code Usage Rules
- **Questions**: Can contain code blocks with syntax highlighting
- **Answers**: NEVER contain code blocks - only plain text
- **Code examples in questions**: Use proper syntax highlighting (```python, ```html, etc.)
- **Code output questions**: Show code in question, expect simple text answer
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ Question: "What does this HTML do?\n```html\n<div class='container'>\n  <h1>Title</h1>\n</div>\n```"
  - ✅ Answer: "Creates a div with class and h1 heading"
  - ❌ Answer: "```html\n<div class='container'>\n  <h1>Title</h1>\n</div>\n```"

## Important Notes
- **Language matching**: ALWAYS use the same language as the user's prompt (German prompt = German response, English prompt = English response)
- **JSON only**: No additional explanations or comments
- **Markdown for questions**: For better formatting in the UI
- **Plain text for answers**: No Markdown formatting in answers
- **Keep answers short**: Maximum 100 characters per answer (prefer 50-80)
- **Code syntax highlighting**: Specify the correct language for code examples
- **Learning-focused**: Cards should contribute to actual learning
- **Varied difficulty levels**: From basics to advanced concepts

## Flashcard Quality Guidelines
- **Answers should be memorizable**: Think "what would I write on a real flashcard?"
- **Avoid verbose explanations**: Prefer "key term" over "detailed explanation"
- **Single concept per card**: Don't try to cover multiple topics in one answer
- **Test the answer**: Could someone recall this answer from just the question?
- **NO CODE IN ANSWERS**: Code blocks belong in questions, not answers
- **Examples of good vs bad answers**:
  - ✅ Good: "class, id" | ❌ Bad: "Die Attribute 'class' und 'id' dienen zur Klassifizierung..."
  - ✅ Good: "function" | ❌ Bad: "A reusable block of code that performs a specific task"
  - ✅ Good: "if, else, elif" | ❌ Bad: "Conditional statements that control program flow"
  - ✅ Good: "HTML" | ❌ Bad: "HyperText Markup Language - the standard markup language for web pages"
  - ✅ Good: "HTML" | ❌ Bad: "```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>...</html>\n```"
  - ✅ Good: "CSS" | ❌ Bad: "```css\nbody { color: red; }\n```"
