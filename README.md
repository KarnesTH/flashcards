# Flashcards ‚Äì Intelligent Learning App

## üìö Project Overview

Flashcards is a modular, AI-enhanced learning application designed to make studying more effective, engaging, and developer-friendly. The project consists of three main components:

- **Backend (Django, Python)**  
  Provides the core API, user management, spaced repetition logic, gamification systems, and handles communication with the AI module.

- **Frontend (Astro + React)**  
  A fast, modern UI that renders Markdown-based flashcards with syntax highlighting, interactive components, and gamified progress tracking.

- **AI Module (Rust)**  
  Responsible for generating flashcard content automatically using AI models based on user-provided topics. The AI logic runs in a standalone Rust service, allowing for efficient, isolated processing.
